Experiments in oTree
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tuesday, 28 November 2017

oTree is a framework based on Python and Django to build controlled behavioral experiments. It was proposed as the online version of zTree. It comes with many useful tools, existing apps and a user-friendly interface. In this session, I will explain some of the promising possibilities of oTree, including browser bots to simulate participants, rooms with persistent links across sessions and a pop-up screen with instructions that tracks how often participants open it. In the second part of the session, you can program some games yourself to get a feeling of the structure of oTree. 

Simulation-based power calculation in R
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tuesday, 15 November 2017

In this session, we provide an introduction to R. No R experience is assumed, though we expect to advance quickly. The goal of this session is to carry out sample size and power calculations. Analytical calculations quickly become cumbersome or infeasible in any realistic study design, hence we focus on a simulation-based approach. 

Stata Tables to LaTeX
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tuesday, 31 October 2017

In this session, we will see how we can make Stata produce beautiful, publication-ready tables for immediate inclusion in LaTeX.

Introduction to Github
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tuesday, 17 October 2017

In this session we will discuss Git and GitHub and how to use it for our research. We will cover all the basics so no prior knowledge is required. However, do follow the steps in the preparation section.

Get-To-Know Meeting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tuesday, 26 September 2017

In the first (informal) meeting we will get to know each other and discuss the plan that we have in mind for the upcoming year. Sandwiches will be served.
